This is NOT an executable file. It is intended to show you how to run it interactively on srun. Otherwise, you can submit the file for batch processing. You should do module loads before you run this (to ensure we have the requisite packages loaded)

srun --gres=gpu:1 -c 8 --mem=12G -p gpu python main.py
